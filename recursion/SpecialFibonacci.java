/*
 * Sankalp recently learned Fibonacci numbers and now he is studying different algorithms to find them. After getting bored of reading them, he came with his own new type of numbers. He defined them as follows:

	 f(0) = a;
	 f(1) = b;
	 f(n) = f(n-1) ^ f(n-2);  when n>1, where ^ denotes the bitwise xor operation.
	You are given three integers a,b and n , calculate f(n).
	
	Input
	
	The input contains one or more independent test cases.
	
	The first line of input contains a single integer T (1≤T≤103), the number of test cases.
	
	Each of the T following lines contains three space-separated integers a, b, and n (0≤a,b,n≤109) respectively.
	
	Output
	
	For each test case, output f(n).
